# Bulk-RNA-seq-Project
Task is to build a RNA-Seq data processing pipeline for a project that involves
generating a GCT (Gene Cluster Text) file as a final output. We will be working with counts
data, and the goal is to process the data for differential
expression and format the results as a GCT file. 
Also give a basic Nextflow outline of how would you design this pipeline from raw fastq. 

Data
Counts file (Please note- Out of 8 sampes, Sample_1 and Sample_7 are control and the rest of the samples are treated).
Using this information make a sample metadata csv file, with samples mentioned in the same order as in counts file and a experiment variable column.
