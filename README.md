# Bulk-RNA-seq-Project
Task is to with build a RNA-Seq data processing pipeline for a project that involves
generating a GCT (Gene Cluster Text) file as a final output. We will be working with counts
data, and the goal is to process the data to obtain differential
expression analysis and format the results as a GCT file. 
Also give a basic Nextflow outline of how would you design this pipeline from raw fastq. 

Data
Counts file (Please note- Sample_1 and Sample_7 are untreated and the rest of the samples are treated).
Using this information make a sample metadata csv file, with samples mentioned in the same order as in counts file and a experiment variable column.
